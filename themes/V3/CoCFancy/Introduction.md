# The Homebrewery - Call of Cthulhu

At night, when the objective world has slunk back into its cavern and left dreamers
to their own, there come inspirations and capabilities impossible at any less magical
and quiet hour. No one knows whether or not he is a writer unless he has tried
writing at night.

###### H.P. Lovecraft

CALL OF CTHULHU
}}

Welcome to The Homebrewerys _Call of Cthulhu_ theme. What you are about to read is not
for the faint of heart; it is a description on how to use this theme in order to
birth the darkest parts of your mind into this world.

The quote after the title is a _title quote_. They can either be full or one
column wide.

{{titleQuote
## The adventure begins

Never Explain Anything

###### H.P. Lovecraft

}}

We begin this section with a description, a block of text that you might read to your
players or use in some other way.

{{descriptive

The drive was long and hard, as the day had turned to night and the rain was pouring
down like from a faucet in the sky. The small country road that you travel on whirls
around fields, forests and old homes far from where any of those more civilized of
mankind would live. Suddenly you break as the headlights shine on some strange creature
crouched in the middle of the road.

As you step out of your car, you can hear that moist figure gnarl and hiss to itself.
You step closer and can see a gross looking man wearing a Hawaiian shirt and
glasses. It is what you've feared; it is _The Programmer_.

:

"Did you know that you can make descriptive boxes using this tag?" he says in a
scratchy voice...

}}

This is a good way to describe something to either yourself or to your players.

If you want something more like a quick fact, a hint or an insert, you can use
either a _note_ or a _descriptive textbox_.

{{note

##### Note

Did you know that The Programmer made this theme as he was procrastinating from
studying for his exam in mathematical statistics? He did not pass that exam...

}}

{{descriptive

##### Descriptive box

If you prefer the look of this instead of a note you can write the text above in
a descriptive box instead.

THE ADVENTURE BEGINS
}}


As you read the descriptive text box, the weird creature on the ground reaches out
towards you and hands you a torn up piece of paper. On that paper there is some
text in a way better handwriting than you would assume from a programmer.

{{letter
{{

## Letters

This is the template for writing a letter, or anything written by hand. It can be
useful for a handout or a clue.

###### The Programmer

}}
}}

Suddenly, the creature that you thought where a man starts to shake violently. As
he mumbles under his breath sharp protrusion starts to grow out of his neck and face,
and long spider-like legs unveils themselves from under his damp cloths.

You run towards your car as the creature hisses "I will describe this as a monster
later in this document!"

## Images
Later that fatefull night you turn in your bed, hopelessly trying to sleep after seing that wretched thing. As your eyelids starts getting heavy, you're suddenly woken up by the faint sound of tapping steps from behind your bedroom door. You watch as something is slid under the doorway. When walking closer you can dissern this to be a polaroid image. That gnarling voice you heard earlier today can be heard from behind the door, now forming something akin to human speach.

"Here is an image of me from my high school prom. Notice how the white frame around the image is blended into the background, leaving the gray inner background with the hand popping out of its frame".

### Distressed images
The polaroid picture suddenly ages in your hand, showing folds an wear in the picture.
"Now the image has a distressed mask over it, adding a bit of grungy texture to show its age. There are fifteen textures that can be selected by putting an element inside the _distressed_ tag. You can change the texture by swapping the name of the images tag to _distressed1_ through _distressed15_. You can also play around with the mask size and position to get different effects".

As you slam open the door ready to either fight or flee from your own home, no one is there. Your livingroom is dark and empty.

Later in the Library
}}

## Later in the Library

As you frantically look through the shelves at you local library in a
maddened state, to understand what it was you saw that evening, you stumble upon
a book.

{{book
{{

## Books

Using the _book_ tag, a keeper can write some explanatory text for either his own
sake, or as a clue for the investigators.

Books are formatted in the same way as the rest of the text in _Homebrewery_ is,
so you can use a lot of the same markdown in order to stylize them. Books can be
used for:

- Literature

- Newspapers

- Documents

and a lot more. Note also that you can, both in books, letters and quotes, use a
sixth level heading to specify an author.

###### The Programmer, _How to make books_

}}
}}

"How did he find me?!" you thought as you slammed the book shut on the table that
you've been reading at. As you try to make out if this book was here by chans or if
it was put here as a trap, you can see in the periphery of your vision
a long arthropod leg reach for you from the top of the bookshelf...

# Characters and Monsters

A character or monster can be implemented using either the _character_ or the
_monster_ block. Here is a character using the _character_ block.

{{cocCharacter

### The Programmer

The man that you met on the street

{{cocStatsBlock

|        |        |        |        |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| STR 40 | CON 45 | SIZ 70 | DEX 45 |
| INT 70 | APP 30 | POW 50 | EDU 75 |

}}

**Hit Points**   : 11

**Damage Bonus** : -

**Build**        : 0

**Move**         : 7

**Magic Points** : 21

:

**Spells** : The programmer can chant a prayer to some old forgotten deity, which
grants him the ability to transform into his arthropod form.

:

**Skills** : Library Use 80%, Science (Programming) 50%,
Cthulhu Mythos 80%, Firearms 30%

}}

_The Programmer_ is, in his human form, a scrappy looking man wearing glasses and a
Hawaiian shirt. When he doesn't spend his evenings out on dark country roads he likes
to drink coffee and work on open source projects.



You can also implement a character or monster using the _monster block_

{{cocCharacter

###  The Programmer - Arthropod form

The programmers transformation

{{cocStatsBlock

|  char.  | averages |  rolls    |
|---------|----------|-----------|
|   STR   |   350    | 7d20x5    |
|   DEX   |   280    | 6d20x5    |
|   CON   |   350    | 7d20x5    |
|   INT   |   265    | 5d20x5    |
|   SIZ   |   270    | 9d12x5    |
|   POW   |   330    | 11d12x5   |

}}

**Hit Points**        : 116

**Damage Bonus**      : +6D6

**Attacks per round** : 4

**Build**             : 20

**Magic Points**      : 21

**Move**              : 10


#### Attacks

**Spider legs** :  The Programmer can attack with four of his eight legs every
round. He can use them to either deal 6D6 bludgeoning damage or to pinch a smaller
creature to the ground effectively grappling them.

**Great knowledge of embedded systems** : When The Programmer doesn't study or write
stuff for Homebrewery, he might actually do his job: Working on embedded systems.
He can ramble on about the pros and cons of using Linux for an embedded platform,
verses using a real time system instead. This will put every living creature within
hearing distance to sleep, and they might only wake up after the rambling is over
or by external force.

**Armor**: 20 points of armor.

**Spells**: The programmer can transform back to his human form at will.

**Sanity Loss**: An investigator that sees  The Programmer in his arthropod form
takes a 1D10/3D10 of sanity loss.

I hope that this theme can be of use to you in your Call of Cthulhu adventures. This
theme uses original open source assets, that are inspired by the publisher _Elsos_
